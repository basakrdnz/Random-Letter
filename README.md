# Random Letter Page

![Random Letter Demo](public/randomletterpagaimg.png)

This project started as a small task given to me, but I decided to expand and shape it further. The core idea of the project is to randomly assign letters from an array to the page when clicking on a specific area with the mouse. We capture the mouse position when clicked, and a letter is placed there. Each new click retains the previous ones, storing them in an array, and they continue to be visible on the page.

There are also three buttons: **Undo**, **Redo**, and **Delete**. These allow the user to undo the last added letter, redo the undone ones, or completely clear the board if you choose to delete all letters.

I also added a small feature: if the mouse passes over a previously placed letter, the letter will "pop" by growing larger and then disappear from the list. However, when there are too many letters on the page, or if the mouse passes over multiple letters at once, the system starts to get a bit buggy. I plan to work on fixing these issues later.

This is an evolving project, and I hope to refine and enhance it as time goes on. Thank you for checking it out and for any feedback you may have!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
